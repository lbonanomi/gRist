## Whats this?

gRist is a simple script for indexing GitHub gists. Besides making a list, gRist attempts to categorize gists based on hashtags in comment[0] and flag duplicate files.


## How would I run this?

Stow an API token blessed for 'gist' access somewhere safe-ish and update the ```token_file``` assignment at the top.
